Q. What is heap memory?
A. Continuous part of virtual address space of the process from which a process claims
and reclaims memory during runtime.

Q. Functions for mem mgmt?
A. malloc, calloc, free

Q. system calls for mem mgmt?
A. brk, sbrk

Q. How does free know how much memory to release?
A. free - internally keeps a track of the associated memory to a pointer by using metablocks just before the actual struct.

****************
block A
allocated
Memory say 30 B
****************
meta info about
block A
isFree: False
size: 30 B 
next: NULL
****************

The next field will be used to create a linked list of memory segments and this will be used for reallocation of memory, splitting, merging

Also, this linked list of meta blocks along with allocated blocks can have memory fragmentation issues.
where the combined free block can satisfy an old request but because they are free in fragments they cannot be used.
